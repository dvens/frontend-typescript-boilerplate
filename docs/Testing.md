## Testing ##
This setup supports both e2e and unit testing by using the following tools:
- [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io/latest/index.html)
- [Jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io/)

The karma configuration can be found within the `karma.conf.js`. An example test can be found within `src/components/atoms/counter-element/counter-element.test.ts`.
