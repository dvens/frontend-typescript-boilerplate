## Generating favicons ##

Generating favicons is based upon one logo within the `/public/logo.png`. You can overwrite this with your own logo. The favicons are generated by [Favicons](https://www.npmjs.com/package/favicons).

- The configuration can be found in `config/favicons.js`
- Run `yarn favicons` to generate the favicons
- The output will be placed within the `pages/_layouts/favicons.njk`
