# Setup #
Welcome to the readme of the TamTam frontend setup.

This is a basic setup for creating (static) html templates.
Filled with automated tasks and configuration options.
It enables you to quickly & easily setup your project and get it running in no time.
Many things are already predefined, added and sorted out for you to take away some hassle.
The pro users can dive into settings an tasks, but that's not required to work with it.


You're always welcome to change settings and reorder things around the project,
as long as you keep the folder structure as is.
This way other developers can get their head around your code and your folder won't become a maze.
