# Setup #
Welcome to the readme of the Frontend setup.

This is a basic setup for creating (static) html templates and dynamic pages through [Express](https://expressjs.com/) and build on top on other tools like: [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), [Webpack](http://webpack.github.io/) and [Browsersync](http://www.browsersync.io/).

Filled with automated tasks and configuration options through [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) and Node Scripts. This gives us the options to make use of [Webpacks: Hot Module Replacement](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/hot-module-replacement/) and the same aliases through Typescript and SASS.

# Features #
__1.__ Express Server for development (and for production if you want SSR).

__2.__ Generating Static Routes (Nunjucks to HTML) and dynamic routes based upon slugs

__3.__ Hot Module Replacement for Typescript and SASS.

__4.__ Dynamic polyfill loader based upon the settings (`config/polyfills.js`).

__5.__ Auto generating and injection of favicons and manifest.json (manageable through `config/favicons.js`).

__6.__ Modern and modern/legacy webpack bundle.

__7.__ Auto generated Serviceworker through Workbox.

__8.__ Styleguide through Storybook.

__9.__ Testing with Karma and Jasmine.

__10.__ Typescript is being used within this setup. [Typescript Cheatsheet](https://github.com/typescript-cheatsheets/react-typescript-cheatsheet).

__11.__ Linting: prettier, eslint and editorconfig.

__12.__ Auto generated favicons by using [Favicons](https://github.com/itgalaxy/favicons).Ã¥

__13.__ Code generator by using [Hygen](http://www.hygen.io/)

__1. Make sure you're on the right node version. (10.x should work)__

__2. Install all the npm modules__

`yarn install`

__3. Start the project in dev mode__

`yarn start`

(See [commands](docs/Commands.md) for the full list)

# Inspired by: #
- [Open Wc](https://open-wc.org/) - Open Web Component Recommendations

# Next Steps #
- TODO: Implement favicons for document
- Add Helmet + refactor helmet to render all tags seperatly.
- Create basic store based upon unistore (but refactor the store in this setup)
- set  window.__INITIAL_STATE__=${serialize(initialState)}; <--- important add serialize-javascript
- Create static router based upon wouter
- Create hashing for files and load them through the server (polyfill loader for dev and prod)
- Create CLI to generate the setup
- Create NPM Packages out of the tools folder
